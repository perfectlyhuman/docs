## Base URL

```
https://api.rapportapi.com
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer rapi_live_YOUR_API_KEY
```

See [Authentication](/authentication) for details on getting and managing your API key.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/research` | Submit a research request (costs 1 credit) |
| `GET` | `/research/{task_id}` | Get research status and results |

## Request flow

```
POST /research → 202 (task_id)
        ↓
Poll GET /research/{task_id} every 4-5s
        ↓
status: "pending" → "running" → "completed"
```

Processing takes ~2-3 minutes. Alternatively, provide a `callback_url` to receive a [webhook](/webhooks) when complete.

## Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `202` | Research accepted, processing asynchronously |
| `400` | Invalid request (missing required fields) |
| `401` | Invalid or missing API key |
| `402` | Insufficient credits |
| `404` | Task not found |

## Rate limits

There are no per-key rate limits. Requests are processed concurrently. If you need high-volume throughput, contact us about an Enterprise plan.
