## How credits work

Each research lookup costs **1 credit**. Credits are included with your subscription plan and reset monthly.

| Plan | Credits/mo | Price |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Solo** | 20 | $49/mo |
| **Team** | 150 | $299/mo |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom |

## Free trial

All plans include a **free 3-day trial** with 3 credits:

1. Sign up and choose a plan
2. Get 3 credits immediately to try the API
3. Your subscription starts 3 days later
4. Cancel before day 3 and you won't be charged

## Credit lifecycle

- **Allocated** when your billing cycle starts (or on signup for trial credits)
- **Deducted** when you submit a research request (1 credit per lookup)
- **Refunded** automatically if a research request fails
- **Reset** at the start of each billing cycle (credits don't roll over)

## Checking your balance

Your current credit balance is visible in the [dashboard](https://rapportapi.com/home). The API also returns a `402` error when you're out of credits:

```json
{
  "detail": "Insufficient credits. Please purchase more at rapportapi.com.",
  "status_code": 402
}
```

## Failed requests

If a research request fails after credits are deducted, we automatically refund the credit to your account. You'll see this as a `refund` transaction in your usage history.
