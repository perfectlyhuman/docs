## What is RapportAPI?

RapportAPI is a sales intelligence API. Send us a person's identifier — email, LinkedIn URL, or name + company — and get back a deep intelligence report in ~2-3 minutes:

- **Icebreaker scripts** sourced from real online activity
- **Communication style guide** tailored to the prospect
- **Background intelligence** (career, education, interests, family)
- **Topics to avoid** so you don't step on landmines

Every insight is sourced from 19+ verified data providers and public information. No guessing, no generic DISC profiles — real, specific details about real people.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a research request">
    POST to `/research` with an email, LinkedIn URL, or name + company. You get back a `task_id` immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for results">
    The pipeline runs asynchronously (~2-3 minutes). Poll with `GET /research/{task_id}` or provide a `callback_url` to receive a webhook when complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the intelligence">
    Get structured JSON with icebreakers, communication style, background data, and a hosted HTML report URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>
