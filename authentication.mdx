## API Keys

All API requests require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer rapi_live_YOUR_API_KEY
```

API keys are prefixed with `rapi_live_` and are generated when you create your account or from the [dashboard](https://rapportapi.com/home).

## Getting your API key

1. [Sign up](https://rapportapi.com/auth/sign-up) or [log in](https://rapportapi.com/auth/sign-in)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Your API key is displayed in the API settings section

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secret.** Don't commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

## Example request

```bash
curl https://api.rapportapi.com/research/TASK_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rapi_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
```

## Error responses

| Status | Error | Cause |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `401` | Missing Authorization header | No `Authorization` header in request |
| `401` | Invalid API key format | Key doesn't start with `rapi_live_` |
| `401` | Invalid or inactive API key | Key not found or has been revoked |
| `402` | Insufficient credits | Account has no remaining credits |

**Example error response:**

```json
{
  "detail": "Insufficient credits. Please purchase more at rapportapi.com.",
  "status_code": 402
}
```

## Security best practices

- Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
- Rotate keys periodically from the dashboard
- Use separate keys for development and production if needed
- Monitor your usage in the dashboard to detect unexpected activity
